# ISANS_Webgame
Final version of the ISANS Webgame developed in the project class CSCI 2691. Utilizes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and PHP for the backend. The game was developed for one of our clients who wanted to provide newcomers and immigrants in Nova Scotia with a hands-on experience of how life is in Canada.
